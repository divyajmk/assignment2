        "1. This paper is about tidying up datasets, and the importance of having clean data along with tidy datasets. Tidy datasets are datasets that are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize as they have a specific structure. In these datasets, each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This structure makes it easier to tidy up messy datasets and to develop tools for data analsyis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard is intended to faciliate initial exploration and analysis of data. These principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. A standard like this is useful as it makes initial data cleaning easier, instead of having to start from scratch every time. This standard has been designed to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together. In the current state of art, current tools require translation and time to use the output from one tool as input for another tool. However, the tidy data standard works to make data analysis eaiser, allowing us to focus on the problem at hand instead of working on the logistics of data (such as data translation).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The first sentence, \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way\", conveys the idea that there is a standard structure or format that tidy datasets follow, making them seem consistent and cohesive in structure like families. Tidy datasets are well-organized and structured; this makes them easier to analyze and work with. On the other hand, messy datasets do not share similar characteristics with other messy datasets, making each dataset messy in its own way. This is because messy datasets can vary widely in terms of how they are disorganized or structured as each messy dataset will have its own unique problems and challenges (i,e., if a column is disorganized, or a row is disorganized, or both, etc.).\n",
        "The second sentence, \"For a given dataset, it's usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general\", conveys the idea that it is usually straightforward to identify the observations and variables within a specific dataset, but defining these observations and variables in a general way can be complex due to the diversity and context-specific nature of data. When looking at a dataset, it is straightforward to identify what the observations and variables are as the observations are typically the rows and the variables are the columns. However, it can be challenging to precisly define observations and variables in a general way that applies universally to all datasets. This is because datasets can vary widely in their structure and purpose. What applies for an observation and variable in one dataset, may not apply in another dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Wickham states that a dataset is a collection of **values** and these values are either numbers (quanitative) or strings (qualitative) that are organized in two ways. Every value can be organized as a variable and an observation. A **variable** contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units; each variable forms a column. On the other hand, an **observation** contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes; each observation forms a row.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined as a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. There are three main characteristics associated with tidy data: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. Tidy data also allows analysts and data scicentsts to easily analyze the needed variables and information since tidy data provides a standard way of structuring a dataset.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are as follows:\n",
        "  - Column headers are seen as values instead of variable names.\n",
        "  - Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
        "  - Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
        "  - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
        "  - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in Table 4 is messy because the column headers are values,instead of variable names. For instance, the column values are prices instead of a variable name. Melting a dataset means that the columns are turned into rows to create tidy datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy as the column headers are values instead of variable names. For instance, the table has column headers like \"d1, d2, etc.\" that are not descriptive or provide the reader with useful information. Table 12a is molten as the element column contains names of variables (i.e., \"tmax\" or \"tmin\") instead of values. Table 12b is tidy as each row represents the meterological measurements for a single day and includes the two measured variables. Also, the minimum (\"tmin\") and maximum (\"tmax\") temperature are column headers, and all other variables are fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem in relation to tidy data states that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be linked to tidy data. This problem refers to a situation in where the usefulness of tidy data and tidy tools are interdependent. Tidy data is only valuable if there are tools designed to work with it effectively, but these tools are reliant on the tidy data structure. Thus, it is easy to get stuck where independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve workflow.\n",
        "Wickham hopes that frameworks related to the cleaning and wrangling of data can be developed to make tasks (such as parsing dates, identifiying missing values, etc.) easier in the future. Wickham also hopes that others will build upon the tidy data framework to develop even better data storage strategies and tools. Additionally, Wickham hopes that there could be tidy tools that can choose between array-tidy and datafram-tidy formats to optimise memory usage and performance.\n"

To clean the 'Price' variable, I removed the \"$\" symbol and the \",\" if they were present. I removed these symbols so the formatting of all the prices within this variable were consistent and had no symbols that could be misinterpeted as invalid values. I also imputed the missing values with 0. This was done to be consistent with the numeric format; since 'Price' is a numeric variable, missing values should not be formatted as a string or a word, but rather a number like 0. After I cleaned, I found that there were 0 missing values.\n",

Since \"Type\" is a categorical variable, it makes more sense for the missing values to be interpreted as 'unknown' instead of 0. Then, I standardized the \"Type\" column to be all lowercase.

        "3. For the WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial variable, I cleaned the variable by replacing the 9s with NaNs. When I read the codebook, I understood that a 9 was labeled as \"Unclear\". I interpreted this as an unknown and missing value, and converted all of these missing values of 9s into NaNs. This was done with the df3[var3].replace(9,np.nan) command. After I converted these missing values into NaNs, I found there to be 31 values that were NaNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. For this step, I first cleaned the SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent variable. I replaced the 4s with 0s and the 9s with NaNs. When I read the codebook, I found that the 4s were labeled as \"Other\", which I thought could be labelled with 0s. The 9s were labelled as \"Not Applicable\", in either that the record was not found or was unknown, so I replaced the 9s with NaNs. For the ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent variable, I replaced the empty strings with NaN as well. Now, for cleaning ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent, I first created a missing value dummy using df3[var4].isnull() to identify the missing values. Then, I wanted to analyze the relationship between the missing values in ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent and the missing values in SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent, so I used the cross tabulation function, pd.crosstab() and printed out the table. This table counted the occurrences of the different combinations of True, indicating missing values, and False, indicating non-missing values, for both variables. This helps better understand if a missing value in one variable is related to a value in the other variable. Next, to handle the missing values, I decided to impute the mean of the ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent variable for the missing values. This decision was made as imputing missing values with the mean helps preserve the overall distrubtion of the existing data as the mean is considered to be a representative measure of central tendency for numeric variables. It keeps the variance and the overall shape of the data relatively stable as well. Initially, I tried imputing the missing values with the median. However, after cleaning the data, I found there to still be 274 NaN values. Therefore, I made the deicison to impute the missing values with the mean to result in 0 NaN values. The ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent variable had to be converted into a numeric data type for the mean to be calculated. The missing values in ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent were replaced with the computed mean. After all of the initial cleaning, handling, and imputing the mean for the missing values, the total number of NaN values in the ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent variable was 0."

        "1. The most recent US Census gathered data on race by following guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Data was gathered through a combination of self-identification questions. Respondents were asked to select their race from a list of options, such as White, Black or African America, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and some other race. Additionally, respondents could select two or more races to indicate their racial identity. The US Census also collected data on ethnicity, asking if respondents were of Spansish, Latino, or Hispanic origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We gather these data to get a better demographic understanding. Gathering data on race is important to track changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of the country over time. Additionally, understanding the racial demographic of the country helps with resource allocation. Resources and funding for public services, infrastructure, and social programs can be allocated better, such as to communities with specific needs like minority populations, with a better understanding of the demographic and its needs.\n",
        "Census data plays a critical role in politics and soceity as it influences political representation at federal, state, and local levels. This data is used to redistrict and determine the number of congressional seats for each state. Also, this data helps politicans to better advertise to specific populations if they wish to gain votes from a specific racial group. Census data also helps society as researchers and policymakers use this data to study social trends in various domains, such as healthcare and education, to better identify disparities or inequalities.\n",
        "Data quality matters as it is important to get accurate data when making informed decisions, such as allocating resources effectively. It is important to make sure that the data is not inaccurate or biased as that can lead to unfair resource distribution or policy decisions, which could affect marginalized communtiies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. I believe that allowing respondents to select multiple racial categories is something that is being done well. By allowing respondents to have option to select more than one race, the US Census is taking an effort to recognize the complexity of racial identity to get a comprehensive picture of the U.S. population. However on the other hand, I believe something that is missing is options and categories that capture the nuances of indivdiuals' racial identities. The US Census currently uses broad racial categories. For example, instead of just having one \"Asian\" category, options that account for specific Asian ethnicites like Indian, Chinese, etc. would be better.\n",
        "Future large scale surveys should take into account how to reach underrepresented and minority populations. Historically, minority groups, such as Native Americans and African American communities, have been undercounted in the Census. Taking efforts to reach these pouplations can be done by making these surveys more accessible to others. This can be done by providing accommdations to those with limited English proficiency and limited access to digital resources.\n",
        "Some of the Census' good practices, such as data security and attempt to provide a comprehensive scope of the racial makeup of the country, can be applied to other wider attempts of data gathering. The Census Bureau has robust measures in place to protect respondents' personal information through data security. Additionally, the Census aims to collect data on a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic factors, which is important for large scale surveys as this data is valulable to government insitutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Data on sex is gathered through a binary categorization; this is done by asking respondents to identify as either male or female. Currently, there is no data being gathered on gender.\n",
        "Something that was done well was allowing respondents to be transparent with their answers by asking for the sex they *identify* with. This helps maintain integrity of the data collected by allowing respondents to answer what they are most comfortable with, instead of feeling pressured to answer the sex they were assigned at birth. However, something that was missing was that data on gender identity was not collected. Tbe diveristy of gender identities beyond the binary gender was not accounted for.  Future large scale surveys should be adjusted to have more inclusive questions that capture a broader range of gender identities and having options for those who are transgender, non-binary, or other gender-diverse individuals. This would allow for a more accurate reflection of the population. The Census' good practices of data privacy and validation can be adopted to wider surveys to gather more data. These practices will make sure that respondents are comfortable with providing their information and that their data will be protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Concerns for cleaning data with protected characteristics, like sexual identity, gender, or race, are issues about privacy and fairness. There are concerns that during the cleaning process, private and personal information could be revealed that lead to the identification of indivdiuals without their consent. Additionally, there is a concern that any biases in data cleaning can perpetuate inequalities and lead to unfair outcomes from analysis of data.\n",
        "Challenges that might arise from missing values are having sparse and biased datasets. Missing values can result in sparse datasets as columns or rows will have missing values; this will make it challenging to draw meaningful conclusions accurately. Also, imputing missing values can introduce bias if not done in a proper way.\n",
        "Some good practices people might adopt is transparency and ethics. It is important to be transparent about data cleaning and the procedures that will be done, so respondents are aware of how their information will be handled. Additionaly, it is critical for people to consider ethical practices to ensure that any imputed values respect the autonomy and identities of respondents. On the other hand, some bad practices people might adopt is ignoring missing values and making uninformed decisions. People could ignore missing values without considering their impact, which is harmful as it can lead to biased or inaccurate analyses. Additionally, making uninformed decisions when cleaning data, such as not consulting the right people or not considering the specific context of the data, can lead to inappropriate handling of sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Concerns that arise with this algorithm are issues about privacy, informed consent of the sensitive data, and accuracy and stereotyping of the imputed values. Individuals should have control over how their personal information is used, so imputing proctected characteristics without consent from the respondents infringes on their privacy. Also, missing values in these protected categories can lead to biased analyses of data as the resulting data won't be an accurate representation of the initial population. This will lead to unfair resource allocation and policy decisions. When handling missing values, algorithms won't quite capture individuals' self-identified characteristics, and will potentially lead to misrepresentation and reinforcement of stereotypes."
